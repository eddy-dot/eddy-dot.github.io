OKR is the short way of saying Objectives and Key Results. And OKR is composed in this way.
1.  Objective #1
    1.  Key result #1
    1.  Key result #2
    1.  Key result #3
1.  Objective #2
    1.  Key result #1
    1.  Key result #2
    1.  Key result #3
1.  Objective #3
    1.  Key result #1
    1.  Key result #2
    1.  Key result #3

An Objective is “what I want to get” and a Key Result is “How do I know I fulfilled the objective”. Key Results must be measurable (# of clients, # of generated leads, % of churn rates, etc).
The objectives are placed each 3 months, or quarters of year(Q1,Q2,Q3,Q4). It is recommended to have 3 objectives and maximum 5 objectives per quarter.   About Key results, it is recommended to have 3 key results per objective, maximum 5(the less, the better, we don’t want to have an objective difficult to measure).
Objectives calcification is measured from %0 to %100 where:
*   <40%        Did not meet objective
*   <70%        Not enough, keep working hard
*   \>80%        Objective was not ambitious
It is recommended to create Business OKRs, based on those OKRs create team OKRs, and based on team OKRs create a personal OKR. With OKR it is not necessary to have a team manager but a leader, now that OKR make people manage it’s own time and objectives.

Example
1.  Objective  Launch website for freelance consulting
    1.  Key result #1 Research and buy the best available domain name by July 1
    1.  Key result #2 Choose and implement the best CMS (content management system) by July 10
    1.  Key result #3 Publish the first blog post by August
