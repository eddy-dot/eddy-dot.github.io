>MVP: minimum viable product(The most basic way to fix a problem)

 <br />

 As **Rise, E** states in his book “Lean Startup” the methodology tries to build a product customers want with small steps, validating learning (Learning from small errors) rather than wasting resources creating a product noone wants.
**Build-Measure-Learn** is the cycle of Lean Startup. First one has an idea, then create an MVP(**Build**), take notes and reviews of your clients(**Measure**), and then make conclusions of the collected data(**Learn**), and then enhance the MPV to keep on reconnecting valuable data, so that the customers pay for the solution.
